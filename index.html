          Iâ€™m a 23-year-old woman originally from NÃ¤ssjÃ¶, Sweden, and currently
          living in EksjÃ¶. I'm a New Media Design student at JTH. Why I chose
          NMD is because I've always been interested in how layout, text and
          design looks and others have told me that I've got an eye for
          designing. Whenever I see some sort of design my OCD kicks in telling
          me whether the text should be put here or there and the content should
          be this and that etc. Also, I find it satisfying and pleasing to look
          at a good design and therefore I want to create good design as well.
          Besides my studies, I work a few days in the week. My strongest
          passions in life involves all forms of physical training, especially
          for gym workouts. Another strong passion includes traveling, exploring
          new places and to plan activities. I also have a deep love for music,
          which means that I love going to concerts and other events that
          involves awesome music. I consider myself an extroverted person who
          loves to be in the company of others. And also, my favorite colour is
          blue if you can't tell ðŸ¤ª.
